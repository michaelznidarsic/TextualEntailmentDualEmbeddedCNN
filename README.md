# TextualEntailmentDualEmbeddedCNN
A 2-input Convolutional Neural Network with word embeddings. Tackles the difficult problem of Textual Entailment using the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus. Demonstrates that a 3-class validation accuracy of 73%+ can be obtained on the corpus without resorting to pre-training, recursion/trees, attention, or LSTM/RNNs.
